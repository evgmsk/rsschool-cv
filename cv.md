## Summary
    
    I'm fifty years old already. I am sure that I am the oldest among the course students. I have a lot of experience and knowledge in various fields, more than my development experience today. But that does not bother me. I continue to live as I did decades ago. I study a lot and work on what satisfies me, fills my life with meaning. A few years ago I discovered programming and a new source of energy sufficient to feel young.
